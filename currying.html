<!-- Currying is a method of making functions more flexible. With a curried function, you can pass all of the arguments that the function is expecting and get the result, or you can pass only a subset of arguments and receive a function back that waits for the rest of the arguments. A simple example of a curry is given below: -->
<html>
<head>
	<title>Currying</title>
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
/*
****Simple
pass a subset of those arguments and get a function back thatâ€™s waiting for the rest of the arguments. It really is that simple.


*/
//innerfunction is important function waiting for both parameters before execute
	function outerfunction(fname){
		return (function innerfunction(lname){
			return fname+" "+lname;
		})
	}
	alert(outerfunction("harshit")("mahajan"));
</script>
</body>
